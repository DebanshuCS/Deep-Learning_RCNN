# Deep-Learning_RCNN

Due to the varied backgrounds in the pictures and variations in data gathering conditions brought on by the sensor geometry and atmospheric factors, detecting aeroplanes from satellite photography is a difficult operation. For the automated identification of aeroplanes, deep learning techniques offer dependable and accurate solutions; nevertheless, a sizable amount of training data is needed to get promising results.

In this project, I used photos from Google Earth (GE) and identify the bounding box of each plane to generate an unique aeroplane identification dataset called High Resolution Planes (HRPlanes). To reflect a diversity of landscape, seasonal, and satellite geometry circumstances acquired from various satellites, HRPlanes includes GE photos of several airports all around the world.

We tested our dataset using two popular object detection algorithms, YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN. My first finding indicate that the used dataset has the potential to be an important data source and benchmark data set for future applications. Furthermore, the proposed architecture and findings of this work might be applied to transfer learning of other datasets and models for aeroplane detection.
